# JSON-LD Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### ✅ Problem 1 Fixed: "Item does not support reviews"
**Root Cause**: Reviews were attached to Organization/Service pages which don't support review markup according to schema.org specifications.

**Solution**: Reviews are now ONLY on Product pages. Organization and Service pages no longer have review properties.

### ✅ Problem 2 Fixed: "Missing reviewed item name"
**Root Cause**: Review objects didn't properly reference the reviewed product with required name property.

**Solution**: All reviews now include `itemReviewed` with complete Product object including `@type`, `@id`, `name`, and `url`.

---

## Files Modified

### 1. `/app/Schema.php`
**Changes**:
- Enhanced `organization()` method to support contactPoint, sameAs, and other Organization properties
- Added new `reviewItemList()` method that maps testimonials to canonical products
- Implemented automatic SKU-to-Product mapping for testimonials

**New Method**: `reviewItemList($reviews, $baseUrl)`
```php
// Maps SKUs to canonical product URLs:
RFP-HOMEFLO-*    → /products/modular-flood-barrier
RFP-MOD-BARRIER  → /products/modular-flood-barrier
RFP-GARAGE-*     → /products/garage-dam-kit
RFP-DOORDAM-*    → /products/garage-dam-kit
RFP-PANEL-*      → /products/doorway-flood-panel
RFP-BASEMENT-*   → /products/doorway-flood-panel
```

### 2. `/app/Controllers/PagesController.php`
**Changes**:
- Updated `home()` method to use Organization schema instead of LocalBusiness
- Removed reviews from homepage (Organization doesn't support them)
- Added proper contactPoint and sameAs properties

**Before**:
```php
Schema::localBusiness(...)  // Wrong type for homepage
```

**After**:
```php
Schema::organization(
    'Flood Barrier Pros',
    Config::get('app_url'),
    Config::get('app_url') . '/logo.png',
    'Rubicon Flood Protection',
    Config::get('phone'),
    Config::get('email'),
    ['https://www.facebook.com/61574735757374/']
)
```

### 3. `/app/Controllers/TestimonialsController.php`
**Changes**:
- Replaced `collectionPage()` with `reviewItemList()`
- Each review now properly points to the canonical product via `itemReviewed`
- All reviews include Product @type, @id, name, and url

**Before**:
```php
Schema::collectionPage(...)  // Reviews not properly linked to products
```

**After**:
```php
Schema::reviewItemList($slice, Config::get('app_url'))
// Generates ItemList with Reviews pointing to Products
```

    "areaServed": "US-FL"
  }],
  "sameAs": ["https://www.facebook.com/61574735757374/"]
}
```
✅ NO reviews (Organization doesn't support them)

### Product Pages (`/products/{product}`)
```json
{
  "@type": "Product",
  "@id": "https://floodbarrierpros.com/products/modular-flood-barrier#product",
  "name": "Modular Flood Barrier System",
  "sku": "RFP-MOD-BARRIER",
  "aggregateRating": {
    "@type": "AggregateRating",
    "ratingValue": "4.7",
    "reviewCount": "6"
  },
  "review": [
    {
      "@type": "Review",
      "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "John Smith"},
      "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "ratingValue": "5"},
      "reviewBody": "These barriers saved our home..."
    }
  ]
}
```
✅ HAS reviews and aggregateRating (Product supports them)

### Testimonials Page (`/testimonials`)
```json
{
  "@type": "ItemList",
  "name": "Customer Testimonials",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "item": {
        "@type": "Review",
        "@id": "https://floodbarrierpros.com/testimonials#rev001",
        "reviewBody": "These barriers saved our home...",
        "itemReviewed": {
          "@type": "Product",
          "@id": "https://floodbarrierpros.com/products/modular-flood-barrier#product",
          "name": "Modular Flood Barrier System",
          "url": "https://floodbarrierpros.com/products/modular-flood-barrier"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Location Pages (`/fl/{city}/{product}`)
```json
{
  "@type": "WebPage",
  "name": "Modular Flood Barrier System – Naples, FL",
  "url": "https://floodbarrierpros.com/fl/naples/modular-flood-barrier",
  "about": {
    "@id": "https://floodbarrierpros.com/products/modular-flood-barrier#product"
  }
}
```
✅ NO reviews (WebPage references product via "about" but doesn't duplicate reviews)

## Technical Notes

### Why ItemList for Testimonials?
The testimonials page uses ItemList with Review objects instead of attaching reviews directly because:
1. The page itself isn't a Product, so it can't have reviews
2. ItemList allows each review to point to its respective Product
3. This helps Google understand which product each review is about
4. The product pages (not testimonials page) will show stars in search results

### SKU Mapping Logic
The system automatically maps city-specific SKUs to canonical products:
- Reviews from Miami, Tampa, Orlando, etc. all point to the same canonical product
- This consolidates review signals for better SEO
- Prevents fragmentation of review data across location-specific pages

### Entity Linking
All Product references use consistent @id values:
- `https://floodbarrierpros.com/products/modular-flood-barrier#product`
- This creates entity relationships across pages
- Helps Google understand your product catalog structure

## Questions?

Common questions:

**Q: Why don't location pages have reviews?**
A: Location pages are WebPage/Service types which don't support reviews. They reference the canonical product via "about" so users can find the full product page with reviews.

**Q: Why doesn't the testimonials page show stars in search?**
A: Only Product pages can show review stars. The testimonials page uses ItemList to map reviews to products, which powers the product pages' review rich results.

**Q: How long until stars appear in search results?**
A: Typically 2-4 weeks after:
- Deploying changes
- Submitting sitemap
- Google re-crawling your pages
- Google validating the structured data

**Q: Can I add more products?**
A: Yes! Update the SKU mapping in `Schema::reviewItemList()` to include new product SKUs and their canonical URLs.
