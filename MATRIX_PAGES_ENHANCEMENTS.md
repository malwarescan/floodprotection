# Matrix Pages Enhancements Summary

## Overview
Enhanced all matrix pages (e.g., `/flood-panels/miami`, `/residential-flood-panels/tampa`) with proper styling, FAQ integration, and improved schema markup.

## Problem Identified
The user reported that pages like `https://floodbarrierpros.com/flood-panels/miami` weren't styled properly. Investigation revealed:
- Matrix pages used custom CSS classes (`.matrix-page`, `.container`, `.sidebar`, etc.)
- These custom classes conflicted with `app.css` line 132-134 `all: unset` rule
- Matrix pages lacked FAQ integration and proper schema markup

## Changes Made

### 1. Template Conversion (app/Templates/matrix-page.php)

### 2. Controller Enhancement (app/Controllers/PagesController.php)
**Updated `matrix()` method:**
- Added FAQ loading via `Faqs::locate()` class

### 3. FAQ Integration
