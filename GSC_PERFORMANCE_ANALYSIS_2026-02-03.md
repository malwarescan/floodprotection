## Executive Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Clicks | 12 |
| Total Impressions | 820 |
| Avg CTR | 1.46% |
| Avg Position | 23.1 |
| Primary Market | United States (98.5% of traffic) |

**Bottom line:** Site is ranking for intent-aligned queries but converting poorly. St. Petersburg / Tampa Bay is the largest impression cluster with almost no clicks. Mobile CTR (2.87%) is nearly 3× desktop (1%); opportunity to lean into mobile-first optimization.

## 1. Query-to-Intent Mismatch (Conversion)

### Observation
High-volume, high-intent queries show strong positions but **0 clicks**:

| Query | Impressions | Position | Issue |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------|
| flood panels miami | 15 | 6.9 | Top 10, zero clicks → SERP/snippet mismatch |
| flood barriers clearwater | 12 | 6.9 | Same pattern |
| riviera beach flood protection | 9 | 4.9 | Pos 4–5 and 0 clicks → title/description weak |
| flood barriers st pete beach | 12 | 14 | Moderate position, no CTR |
| flood barriers st petersburg | 9 | 28.7 | Weak position, high volume |

### Actionable Insights
1. **Titles & descriptions:** Queries like “flood panels miami” and “riviera beach flood protection” appear in top 7 but get no clicks. Likely causes: weak value prop, unclear differentiation, generic copy.
2. **SERP previews:** Audit how snippets render in mobile vs desktop; adjust title length and meta description to improve CTR at positions 5–10.
3. **St. Petersburg cluster:** 40+ queries center on St. Pete; combined volume is high but CTR is near zero. Treat as a priority cluster for content and on-page optimization.

---

## 2. St. Petersburg / Tampa Bay as Strategic Cluster

### Data
- 50+ queries include “st. petersburg” or “st. petersburg fl”
- Combined impressions: ~150+ (roughly 18% of total)
- Total clicks from these: 0
- Top pages with impressions:
  - `city/st-petersburg` — 112 impressions, 0 clicks

  - `fl/st-petersburg/modular-flood-barrier` — 33 impressions, 0 clicks
  - `fl/st-petersburg/garage-dam-kit` — 23 impressions, 0 clicks

### Actionable Insights
1. **Dedicated St. Pete landing strategy:** Create or refine a focused St. Petersburg hub: local proof, projects, neighborhoods (Shore Acres, Snell Isle), and clear CTAs.
2. **Query-specific pages:** Map top queries (e.g., “flood barriers snell isle”, “flood barriers shore acres”) to specific content and URLs.
3. **Internal linking:** Ensure city page, service pages, and product pages are strongly interlinked for St. Pete and related areas.
4. **Conversion focus:** Add phone, form, and quote CTAs above the fold and in sticky elements.

## 3. Mobile as Primary Conversion Channel

### Data
| Device | Impressions | Clicks | CTR | Position |
|--------|-------------|--------|-----|----------|
| Desktop | 600 | 6 | 1.00% | 23.68 |

| Tablet | 11 | 0 | 0% | 9.36 |

### Actionable Insights

2. **Mobile UX:** Review tap targets, form fields, and call buttons on key landing pages.
3. **Mobile snippets:** Ensure titles stay under ~60 chars and descriptions under ~155 chars for mobile SERP display.
4. **Tablet:** Small sample; monitor for trends; ensure tablet layouts mirror mobile behavior.

## 4. Rich Results Underperforming

### Data
| Appearance | Clicks | Impressions | CTR | Position |
|------------|--------|-------------|-----|----------|
| Review snippet | 3 | 152 | 1.97% | 19.47 |
| Product snippets | 1 | 130 | 0.77% | 39.06 |

### Actionable Insights
1. **Product snippets:** 130 impressions, 1 click, avg position ~39. Product schema and/or targeting may not match user intent or top queries.
2. **Review snippets:** Better CTR (1.97%) than organic average; prioritize maintaining and growing review schema and review volume.
3. **Schema coverage:** Extend review/product markup to core location and service pages.
4. **Product queries:** Align product pages and schema with queries like “garage door flood barrier,” “modular flood barriers,” “flood proof garage doors.”

## 5. High-Potential Pages (Quick Wins)

### Pages with High CTR, Low Volume
| Page | CTR | Position | Impressions | Action |
|------|-----|----------|-------------|--------|
| home-flood-barriers/marco-island | 50% | 1 | 4 | Boost visibility for Marco Island |
| home-flood-barriers/inverness | 100% | 1 | 1 | Replicate strategy for similar markets |
| residential-flood-panels/new-port-richey | 50% | 7 | 2 | Expand content and internal links |
| residential-flood-panels/jupiter | 100% | 9 | 1 | Use as template for other cities |
| city/tampa | 20% | 17.2 | 5 | Strengthen content for Tampa queries |
| flood-protection-for-homes/port-charlotte | 33.33% | 13 | 3 | Scale content and backlinks |

### Actionable Insights
1. **Replication:** Use high-CTR pages (Marco Island, Jupiter, Inverness, New Port Richey) as templates for structure, headings, and CTAs.
2. **Featured snippets:** Marco Island and Inverness at position 1 are strong candidates for featured snippet optimization.
3. **Tampa:** Higher CTR than St. Pete; improve Tampa content and linking to capture more St. Pete–adjacent queries.

## 6. Zero-Click / Impression Sink Pages

### Pages with Most Impressions, Zero Clicks
| Page | Impressions | Position | Likely Issue |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| city/st-petersburg | 112 | 22.67 | Weak relevance/snippet for top queries |
| products/modular-flood-barrier | 51 | 31.06 | Product schema/position weak |
| home-flood-barriers/st-petersburg | 44 | 13.25 | Good position, snippet not compelling |
| products/garage-dam-kit | 41 | 50.98 | Poor position, likely wrong intent |
| blog/portable-vs-permanent-flood-barriers | 34 | 13.41 | Informational; needs stronger CTA |
| commercial-flood-gates | 31 | 30.1 | Commercial intent, may need dedicated content |
| home-flood-barriers/fort-myers | 33 | 26.52 | Fort Myers cluster, similar to St. Pete |

### Actionable Insights
1. **city/st-petersburg:** A/B test title and description; add stronger local proof and urgency.
2. **products/modular-flood-barrier & garage-dam-kit:** Map to “garage flood barrier,” “modular flood barriers,” “flood proof garage doors”; improve on-page match and schema.
3. **home-flood-barriers/st-petersburg:** Position 13 with 0 CTR suggests snippet is the bottleneck; test more specific, benefit-driven copy.
4. **commercial-flood-gates:** If commercial is a target segment, build a clear commercial hub and align schema and content.

---

## 7. Commercial vs. Residential Intent

### Query Patterns
- **Residential:** “flood panels miami,” “home flood barriers,” “residential flood protection”
- **Commercial:** “commercial flood gates,” “commercial flood barriers,” “flood gate manufacturers,” “commercial flood proofing”
- **Product-specific:** “garage door flood barrier,” “modular flood barriers,” “flood proof garage door”

### Actionable Insights
1. **Commercial:** Queries exist (e.g., commercial flood gates, flood gate manufacturers) but positions are weak (pos 30–89). Evaluate if commercial is a strategic segment; if yes, create dedicated commercial content and landing pages.
2. **Product pages:** Product URLs underperform; align content and schema with high-intent product queries.
3. **Near me:** Several “near me” and “st. petersburg fl” queries; optimize local pages and local schema for these.

---

## 8. International Traffic (Non-Converters)

### Data
- US: 739 impressions, 12 clicks (1.62% CTR)
- UK: 11 impressions, pos 6.9, 0 clicks
- Others: 89 impressions across 35+ countries, 0 clicks

### Actionable Insights
1. **Focus:** Traffic is US-dominated; maintain US/local focus for now.
2. **International:** No need to invest in geo-targeting or hreflang unless expanding internationally.
3. **UK:** 11 impressions at strong position; likely low relevance (Florida-focused). Consider geo-restriction or clarifying US/FL focus if UK traffic is not desired.

---

## 9. Non-WWW Cannibalization

### Data
Non-www URLs still receiving impressions:
- floodbarrierpros.com/city/st-petersburg — 44 impressions
- floodbarrierpros.com/home-flood-barriers/clearwater — 14 impressions
- floodbarrierpros.com/city/gulfport — 9 impressions
- Additional non-www variants across Pages data

### Actionable Insights
1. **Redirects:** Confirm 301s from non-www to www are in place and working.
2. **Canonicals:** Ensure all key pages use www canonical URLs.
3. **Index consolidation:** Use GSC to validate that non-www URLs are dropping from the index over time.
