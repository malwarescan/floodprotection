# Google Search Console Schema Fixes - Executive Summary

## ‚úÖ ALL FIXES COMPLETE

Two critical Google Search Console errors have been successfully fixed across ~170 pages.

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Missing field 'offerCount' (in 'offers')
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Pages Affected**: ~170 pages  
**Root Cause**: Product schemas were missing the required `offers` property, or using `AggregateOffer` without the required `offerCount` field.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added smart offer logic to all Product schema methods
- When prices differ: Use `AggregateOffer` with `offerCount: 3`
- When single price: Use simple `Offer` 
- All offers include: `price`/`lowPrice`/`highPrice`, `priceCurrency`, `availability`, `url`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Invalid URL in field 'id' (in 'itemListElement.item')
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Pages Affected**: All pages with breadcrumbs  
**Root Cause**: BreadcrumbList items were using relative URLs (`/products`) instead of absolute URLs with `@id` structure.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated `breadcrumb()` method to convert all URLs to absolute
- Changed structure from `"item": "/path"` to `"item": {"@id": "https://...", "name": "..."}`
- All breadcrumb URLs now include full scheme and host
