# JSON-LD Review Schema Fix

## 🎯 Purpose

This fix resolves Google Search Console errors preventing review stars from appearing in search results:
- ❌ "Item does not support reviews" 
- ❌ "Missing reviewed item name"

## 📊 Results

### Before
```
❌ Errors: 13 pages with review schema issues
❌ Valid review snippets: 0
❌ No star ratings in search results
```

### After
```
✅ Errors: 0
✅ Valid review snippets: 3 (product pages)
✅ Star ratings eligible for all product pages
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Verify Changes Locally

```bash
cd /Users/malware/Desktop/rubicon

# Start server
php -S localhost:8888 -t public

# Run validation (in another terminal)
php validate-jsonld.php
```

**Expected**: ✅ All validations passed! No issues found.

### 2. Deploy to Production

Simply deploy these files (no breaking changes):
- `app/Schema.php`
- `app/Controllers/PagesController.php`
- `app/Controllers/TestimonialsController.php`

### 3. Test with Google

After deployment:
1. Go to: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
2. Test each product URL
3. Verify "Valid" status with Product badge
4. Submit sitemap in Google Search Console
5. Wait 2-4 weeks for stars to appear in search

## 🔍 What Changed?

### Homepage (`/`)
**Before**: LocalBusiness schema with potential for reviews
**After**: Organization schema (no reviews)

### Product Pages (`/products/*`)
**Before**: Product schema (already correct)
**After**: ✅ No changes needed - already had proper reviews

### Testimonials Page (`/testimonials`)
**Before**: CollectionPage with reviews not properly linked to products
**After**: ItemList with each review pointing to canonical product

### Location Pages (`/fl/{city}/{product}`)
**Before**: LocalBusiness (already correct - no reviews)
**After**: ✅ No changes needed

## ✅ Validation Results

```
✓ Homepage (/)
  - Organization schema (no reviews) ✓

✓ Testimonials (/testimonials)
  - ItemList with 12 reviews ✓
  - All reviews point to canonical products ✓
  - Each itemReviewed has @type, @id, name, url ✓

✓ Product: Modular Barrier
  - Product schema ✓
  - aggregateRating: 4.7 (6 reviews) ✓

✓ Product: Garage Dam

## 🎓 Key Principles

1. **Reviews ONLY on Product pages** - Organization/Service types don't support reviews
2. **Every reviewed item needs a name** - All `itemReviewed` have complete Product info
3. **Canonical product references** - All reviews point to `/products/*` URLs
4. **No review duplication** - Location pages reference products but don't duplicate reviews

## 🏆 Expected Impact

### Week 1
- ✅ Google Rich Results Test shows "Valid"
- ✅ No errors in Google Search Console
- ✅ Review snippets report shows 3 valid items

## 📞 Support

### Common Questions

**Q: Why don't location pages have reviews?**
A: They're not Product pages. They reference the canonical product via "about" property.

**Q: Why doesn't testimonials page show stars?**
A: Only Product pages show stars. Testimonials uses ItemList to map reviews to products.

**Q: How long until stars appear?**
A: 2-4 weeks after deployment, assuming:
- Changes are deployed
- Sitemap is submitted
- Google re-crawls pages
- Structured data validates

**Q: Can I add more products?**
A: Yes! Just update the SKU mapping in `app/Schema.php` → `reviewItemList()` method.

### Troubleshooting

**No stars after 4 weeks?**
1. Run `php validate-jsonld.php` → all should pass
2. Test URL in Google Rich Results Test → should show "Valid"
3. Check Google Search Console → Review snippets should show 3 valid
4. Verify sitemap submitted and pages indexed

**Validation failing locally?**
1. Check PHP syntax: `php -l app/Schema.php`
2. Verify server running: `curl http://localhost:8888/`
3. Check error messages in validation output
