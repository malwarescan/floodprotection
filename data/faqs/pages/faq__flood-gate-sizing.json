        "q": "How do I determine the correct size for my flood gate?",
        "a": "<p>Measure the clear opening width and height, then add 2 inches for side-seal compression. Our engineers verify dimensions during the <a href=\"/faq/site-survey-process\">site survey process</a>. Gates over 8 ft require mid-span reinforcement to meet ASTM E330 deflection limits.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Can one flood gate cover multiple doorways?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—modular gates can span adjoining doorways up to 12 ft using coupler plates. Each segment retains independent seals, simplifying replacement. See <a href=\"/products/modular-flood-barrier\">Modular Flood Barrier</a> specs.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "What clearance do I need above the sill?",
        "a": "<p>At least 3 inches of unobstructed vertical clearance ensures full gasket compression and quick deployment. Trim decorative thresholds as required.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "How high should the barrier be relative to flood level?",
        "a": "<p>Height = Design Flood Elevation (BFE + 1 ft freeboard) – finished floor. Our software calculates optimum height for each zone (<a href=\"/home-flood-barriers/sarasota\">Sarasota</a>, <a href=\"/home-flood-barriers/naples\">Naples</a> etc.).</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Are oversize flood gates difficult to operate?",
        "a": "<p>No—panels under 80 lb include recessed handles and assisted clamps. Larger assemblies use counterbalanced hinges or motorized lifts.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "How precise must sizing be?",
        "a": "<p>±1 mm tolerance on width, ±2 mm on height yields full seal. Even small deviations can halve pressure resistance, so professional measurement is recommended.</p>"
