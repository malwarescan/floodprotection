        "q": "How often should I inspect my flood barriers?",
        "a": "<p>Visual inspection every six months and after each deployment. Check gasket compression, anchor torque, and track cleanliness. Annual professional inspection keeps certification active. See <a href=\"/faq/gasket-replacement\">gasket replacement</a>.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "What cleaning products are safe for aluminum barriers?",
        "a": "<p>Use pH-neutral detergent and soft cloth. Avoid chlorine or acidic cleaners—they accelerate corrosion. Rinse with fresh water after each storm, especially in coastal zones like <a href=\"/home-flood-barriers/naples\">Naples</a>.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Do I need to lubricate components?",
        "a": "<p>Apply silicone-based spray to compression bolts and clamps twice per year. Never use petroleum grease on EPDM gaskets; it causes swelling.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Can I pressure-wash flood panels?",
        "a": "<p>Yes at low pressure (<2,000 psi) with a wide fan tip. Direct spray downward, not under gaskets. Remove panels before washing façades.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "How do I store panels off-season?",
        "a": "<p>Stack vertically with foam spacers in a dry, shaded area. Avoid concrete contact to prevent galvanic staining. Follow <a href=\"/faq/panel-storage-tips\">panel storage tips</a> for full details.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "What voids the maintenance warranty?",
        "a": "<p>Skipping annual inspection or using unapproved sealants/paints. We log each service for traceability per FEMA TB-3 Appendix C.</p>"
