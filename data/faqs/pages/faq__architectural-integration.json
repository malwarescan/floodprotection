        "q": "How can flood barriers be integrated into modern architecture?",
        "a": "<p>Design coordination early in the project allows recessing tracks into thresholds and color-matching façades. We work with architects to conceal hardware. See <a href=\"/faq/doorway-flood-panel-custom\">custom doorway panels</a>.</p>"

    {
        "q": "Can barriers align with minimalist design?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—flush-mount tracks and matte finishes maintain clean lines. Hidden fasteners create seamless transitions.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Are custom frame shapes possible?",
        "a": "<p>Curved or angled openings can be scanned and CNC-milled for precise fit. Ideal for architectural statements and boutique storefronts.</p>"

        "q": "Do integrated systems affect accessibility?",
        "a": "<p>No—ADA-compliant low-profile thresholds preserve wheelchair access when barriers are removed.</p>"

    {
        "q": "How do architects document floodproofing in drawings?",
        "a": "<p>Include plan, elevation, and section with barrier height, track depth, and deployment notes. Reference <a href=\"/faq/asce24-compliance\">ASCE 24 compliance</a>.</p>"
