        "q": "What powder-coating finishes are available for flood barriers?",
        "a": "<p>Standard RAL 9003 white, 7035 light gray, 7021 charcoal. Custom colors on request. UV-stable polyester resists chalking for &gt; 15 years coastal exposure.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Does powder coating affect barrier performance?",
        "a": "<p>No—coating thickness &lt; 80 µm adds minimal tolerance and actually protects from galvanic corrosion. Always bake below 200 °C to preserve gasket bond.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Can panels be re-coated later?",
        "a": "<p>Yes, after light media blast and solvent wipe. Use identical polyester resin to maintain gloss uniformity. Refer to <a href=\"/faq/flood-panel-repair\">flood-panel repair</a> for prep steps.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Are matte or gloss finishes better for coastal climates?",
        "a": "<p>Matte hides salt deposits and micro-scratches; gloss reflects heat. Choice is aesthetic—both carry identical corrosion ratings.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Do color changes void warranty?",
        "a": "<p>No—warranty follows structural frame, not finish, provided coatings meet AAMA 2604 standards.</p>"
