        "q": "What should I look for in a flood-barrier contractor?",
        "a": "<p>Choose licensed installers with FEMA TB-3 training, in-house engineering, and local permit experience. Ask for PE-stamped drawings and product test data.</p>"

    {
        "q": "How do I verify experience?",
        "a": "<p>Request references or visit completed projects in your county. Check permits under contractor license numbers at local building departments.</p>"

        "q": "Do national brands subcontract installs?",
        "a": "<p>Often yes. We manage installation directly for consistent quality across <a href=\"/home-flood-barriers/miami\">Miami</a> and <a href=\"/home-flood-barriers/naples\">Naples</a> markets.</p>"

    {
        "q": "Should I get multiple quotes?",
        "a": "<p>Yesâ€”compare total scope: engineering, permitting, installation, and warranty. Cheapest quote isn't always code-compliant.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "What warranties should be offered?",
        "a": "<p>Look for 10-year structural, 3-year hardware, and workmanship guarantees. See <a href=\"/faq/warranty-coverage\">warranty coverage</a>.</p>"
