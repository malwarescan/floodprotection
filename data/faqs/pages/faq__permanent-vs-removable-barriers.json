        "q": "What is the difference between permanent and removable flood barriers?",
        "a": "<p>Permanent systems stay fixed year-round; removable panels store off-season. Both use identical seals. Choice depends on aesthetics, space, and frequency of flooding.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Which is more cost-effective?",
        "a": "<p>Removable barriers cost 30 % less upfront. Permanent units require higher material cost but zero setup time.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Do permanent barriers affect curb appeal?",
        "a": "<p>Minimal—low-profile thresholds and color-matched finishes hide them in plain sight. See <a href=\"/faq/architectural-integration\">architectural integration</a>.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Can removable panels be deployed by one person?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—lightweight aluminum panels average 18 lb per section and deploy in under 5 minutes per doorway.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Which option do insurers prefer?",
        "a": "<p>Either, as long as documentation shows compliance with FEMA TB-3 and proper maintenance logs. See <a href=\"/faq/flood-barrier-insurance-benefits\">insurance benefits</a>.</p>"
