        "q": "How do flood barriers compare to sandbags?",
        "a": "<p>Barriers deploy faster, form airtight seals, and can be reused. Sandbags leak, require disposal, and introduce contaminated waste. One 6-ft barrier replaces over 150 sandbags. See <a href=\"/products/modular-flood-barrier\">Modular Flood Barrier</a>.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Are sandbags cheaper?",
        "a": "<p>Initially yes, but disposal and labor make them more expensive after two storms. Barriers pay for themselves within two flood events.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Do sandbags provide the same protection height?",
        "a": "<p>No—standard stacks protect only 12–18 inches. Engineered barriers protect 24–48 inches or more, with verified hydrostatic ratings.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Can barriers and sandbags be used together?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—sandbags can divert runoff toward barrier edges on uneven ground, but barriers remain the primary defense.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Which option is better for long-term mitigation?",
        "a": "<p>Reusable barriers—cleaner, faster, and accepted by FEMA as dry-floodproofing equipment. Sandbags are for emergencies only.</p>"
