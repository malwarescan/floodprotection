        "q": "How do you protect glass façades from flooding?",
        "a": "<p>We install base tracks and removable aluminum panels across the mullions. Transparent polycarbonate infills maintain daylight while sealing against water. See <a href=\"/products/modular-flood-barrier\">Modular Flood Barrier</a>.</p>"

        "q": "Will barriers block visibility?",
        "a": "<p>Not necessarily—clear inserts and low-profile framing preserve storefront transparency during off-season.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Can frameless glass doors be sealed?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—compression sill systems use surface gaskets with no drilling into glass. Suitable for showrooms and condos.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Do glass façades require special testing?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—ASTM E331 water-penetration and E1886 impact tests verify performance under hydrostatic and debris loads.</p>"

    {
        "q": "Are coatings or films needed?",
        "a": "<p>Optional hydrophobic films ease cleanup after deployment. They do not replace structural protection.</p>"
