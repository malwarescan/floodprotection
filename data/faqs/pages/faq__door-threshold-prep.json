        "q": "Why is threshold preparation important for flood barriers?",
        "a": "<p>Uneven or porous thresholds compromise gasket compression, allowing seepage. We level surfaces to ±1 mm and seal with polyurethane to meet FEMA TB-3 requirements.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "What materials work best for rebuilding thresholds?",
        "a": "<p>Epoxy mortar or polymer-modified cement provides smooth, non-absorbent surfaces. Avoid silicone caulk—it compresses unevenly under hydrostatic load.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "How do you treat wooden door sills?",
        "a": "<p>We overlay with aluminum sub-plates anchored through to the joist. This prevents water wicking through grain and meets ASCE 24-14 §6.2.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Can thresholds be waterproofed without removing the door?",
        "a": "<p>Yes. Low-profile retrofit plates slide beneath weatherstripping and use removable edge gaskets. Ideal for historic homes.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "How is slope correction measured?",
        "a": "<p>Laser levels map the sill plane; we correct variances greater than 1⁄8 inch per 4 ft. Smoother thresholds ensure full gasket contact with <a href=\"/products/doorway-flood-panel\">Doorway Flood Panels</a>.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Do you provide warranty on threshold work?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—5 years on bonding integrity and waterproof seal adhesion.</p>"
