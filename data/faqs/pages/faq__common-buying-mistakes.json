        "a": "<p>1) Choosing non-engineered imports, 2) Ignoring permit requirements, 3) Underestimating flood height, 4) Skipping maintenance, 5) Poor installation alignment.</p>"

    {
        "q": "Why avoid non-engineered products?",
        "a": "<p>They lack certified load data, often fail inspections, and void insurance eligibility. Always use tested systems like our <a href=\"/products/doorway-flood-panel\">Doorway Flood Panel</a>.</p>"

        "q": "How do I avoid measurement errors?",
        "a": "<p>Use professional surveys with laser measurement. Even â…›-inch misalignment causes gasket leaks.</p>"

    {
        "q": "Should I rely on DIY online kits?",
        "a": "<p>Not for structural flood loads. DIY kits may help with minor seepage but not FEMA-defined floods.</p>"

        "q": "How can I verify a product's legitimacy?",
        "a": "<p>Check for ASTM E330 test reports, engineering stamps, and company registration with Florida DBPR.</p>"
