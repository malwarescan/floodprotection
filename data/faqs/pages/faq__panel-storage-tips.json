        "q": "How should I store flood panels between seasons?",
        "a": "<p>Keep indoors, vertical on padded racks, gasket side up. Avoid direct sunlight and stacked storage. Humidity &lt; 70 % prevents mold and oxidation.</p>"

        "q": "Can panels be stored outdoors?",
        "a": "<p>Short-term only, under waterproof cover with airflow gap. Never rest directly on soil or concrete.</p>"

        "q": "Should I remove gaskets during long storage?",
        "a": "<p>No—leave installed but relieve clamp tension to avoid compression set. Apply talc dusting to maintain elasticity.</p>"

        "q": "What's the best way to label panels for quick deployment?",
        "a": "<p>Use color-coded tags matching opening ID drawings from your <a href=\"/faq/site-survey-process\">site survey</a>. Keeps deployment under 10 minutes.</p>"
