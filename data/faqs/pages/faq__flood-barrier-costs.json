        "q": "How much do residential flood barriers cost?",
        "a": "<p>Typical residential projects range from $2,000–$10,000 depending on opening count, width, and height. Multi-panel garage installs average $4,800. Doorway panels start around $1,200. See <a href=\"/products/modular-flood-barrier\">Modular Flood Barrier</a> for examples.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Why do prices vary so widely?",
        "a": "<p>Costs depend on barrier height, anchoring complexity, finish, and certification level. FEMA-aligned engineered systems cost more but may reduce insurance premiums.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Are quotes free?",
        "a": "<p>Yes. We provide digital site surveys with itemized estimates. For most Florida counties, same-week assessments are available. Visit <a href=\"/home-flood-barriers/naples\">Naples</a> or <a href=\"/home-flood-barriers/sarasota\">Sarasota</a> pages to request.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "What is the most cost-effective configuration?",
        "a": "<p>Standard aluminum removable panels—easy to store and reuse. Fixed motorized units carry higher upfront costs but lower long-term labor expenses. See <a href=\"/faq/permanent-vs-removable-barriers\">permanent vs removable barriers</a>.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Do I pay extra for permits or engineering?",
        "a": "<p>Permit and PE stamping fees are included in most proposals. Complex coastal projects may add $250–$600 for specialty calculations.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Can I finance installation?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—through partner lenders offering 6–24 month deferred-interest plans. Many homeowners pair this with insurance savings for net-zero out-of-pocket cost.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "What long-term costs should I expect?",
        "a": "<p>Annual inspection (~$150), occasional gasket replacement (~$50 per panel), and resealing after severe storms. Refer to <a href=\"/faq/flood-barrier-maintenance\">maintenance guide</a>.</p>"
