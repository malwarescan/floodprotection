        "q": "How do you install flood panels on wide garage openings?",
        "a": "<p>We divide openings into 4–6 ft modular bays joined by compression posts. Each post transfers hydrostatic pressure to the slab. A 16-ft double-door garage typically uses three panels with two posts rated for 4 psi water load.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Can flood panels operate with existing garage doors?",
        "a": "<p>Yes. Tracks mount externally without interfering with door operation. Panels deploy only during storm alerts and store in wall-mounted brackets afterward.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Do garage installations require structural reinforcement?",
        "a": "<p>Only if jambs are non-masonry or wood. We add steel inserts or backer plates to achieve pull-out strength ≥1,200 lb per anchor.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "How much time is needed to deploy garage flood panels?",
        "a": "<p>A trained homeowner can secure a two-car opening in 5–7 minutes. Quick-lock cam clamps eliminate the need for tools.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "What is the recommended storage method?",
        "a": "<p>Store panels vertically on padded brackets, gasket side up. Avoid stacking horizontally to prevent compression damage.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Can garages with decorative pavers support flood tracks?",
        "a": "<p>Yes, we core through pavers into the structural slab and use flush inserts. After season, covers keep anchors invisible.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Where can I see a working demo?",
        "a": "<p>Visit our <a href=\"/home-flood-barriers/clearwater\">Clearwater garage flood-panel installation</a> site or schedule a virtual demonstration.</p>"
