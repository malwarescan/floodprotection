        "q": "How do flood barriers support climate-change adaptation?",
        "a": "<p>They provide scalable protection against rising sea levels and intensified storms—key adaptation tools in resilient design. FEMA and NOAA recommend dry-floodproofing for coastal resilience planning.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Are flood barriers a permanent solution?",
        "a": "<p>They mitigate risk for decades but must evolve with local sea-level projections. Annual reassessment ensures coverage remains above design flood elevation.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Can they be integrated into larger climate strategies?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—paired with permeable landscapes, rainwater capture, and backup power, barriers form part of holistic resilience systems.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "How do barriers compare with elevation projects?",
        "a": "<p>Barriers are faster, reversible, and lower-cost alternatives to raising entire structures. Ideal for retrofits and historic buildings.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Do local governments include barriers in adaptation plans?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—many Florida municipalities now reference deployable flood barriers in hazard-mitigation and adaptation policies.</p>"
