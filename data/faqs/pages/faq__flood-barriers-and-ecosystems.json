        "q": "Do flood barriers harm local ecosystems?",
        "a": "<p>No—barriers protect built environments without interfering with wetlands or natural drainage. Unlike levees, they do not alter watercourses or block wildlife corridors.</p>"

        "q": "Can barriers be used in sensitive environmental zones?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—temporary or removable systems are approved for coastal dunes and conservation areas because they leave no permanent footprint.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Do installation activities disturb soil or vegetation?",
        "a": "<p>Minimal disturbance. Anchors use small core holes (≤ ½ inch) and do not require excavation. Work is completed within a day.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Can barriers reduce contamination after floods?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—by stopping floodwater entry, they prevent household chemicals, sewage, and fuels from spreading into soil and storm drains.</p>"

        "q": "Are any eco-certifications available?",
        "a": "<p>Our materials comply with ISO 14001 environmental-management standards and meet FEMA's sustainability guidelines under the National Mitigation Framework.</p>"
