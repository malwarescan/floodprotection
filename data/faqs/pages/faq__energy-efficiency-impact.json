        "q": "Do flood barriers affect energy efficiency?",
        "a": "<p>Only minimally. When installed, panels act as additional insulation layers, reducing air infiltration at doors and garages. No effect when removed.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Can barriers improve building envelope performance?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—tight gasket seals reduce rate drafts. Some owners note lower HVAC costs when panels remain temporarily in place post-storm season.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Do barrier materials retain heat?",
        "a": "<p>Aluminum reflects solar radiation; it does not significantly store heat. Interior temperature impact is negligible.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Are there heat-loss concerns with permanent installations?",
        "a": "<p>Minimal—thermal breaks and foam cores in fixed systems prevent cold bridging.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Can flood protection be combined with energy retrofits?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—during door or façade upgrades, integrate both for improved efficiency and resilience. See <a href=\"/faq/architectural-integration\">architectural integration</a>.</p>"
