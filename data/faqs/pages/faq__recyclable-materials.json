        "q": "Are flood barriers recyclable at the end of their life?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—aluminum, stainless steel, and EPDM gaskets are recyclable. 95 % of system mass returns to raw material cycles, reducing embodied carbon footprint.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Which materials are most sustainable?",
        "a": "<p>Marine-grade aluminum for panels and 316 stainless for hardware. Both resist corrosion without toxic coatings and retain full recyclability.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Do recycled metals weaken barrier performance?",
        "a": "<p>No—recycled aluminum billets meet ASTM B221 standards and perform identically to virgin material.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "How should materials be disposed or repurposed?",
        "a": "<p>Remove rubber seals, separate metals, and bring to certified recyclers. We provide a recycling sheet with every replacement order.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Are packaging materials eco-friendly?",
        "a": "<p>We use recycled cardboard and reusable corner protectors; no styrofoam. See <a href=\"/faq/environmental-impact\">environmental impact</a>.</p>"
