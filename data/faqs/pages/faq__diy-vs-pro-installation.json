        "q": "Is DIY flood-barrier installation realistic for homeowners?",
        "a": "<p>DIY kits work for single-opening doorways but require precision alignment within 2 mm. Misalignment can cause leaks under pressure. Professional installation ensures engineering compliance and warranty validity.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "What risks come with self-installation?",
        "a": "<p>Common issues include under-torqued anchors, uneven gasket compression, and unsealed masonry pores. Each reduces hydrostatic resistance by 15–30 %.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "How much does professional installation cost compared to DIY?",
        "a": "<p>Professional labor averages 15–20 % of total system cost. Considering avoided failures and warranty coverage, ROI typically occurs within one event cycle.</p>"

    {
        "q": "Can I install panels and have them certified later?",
        "a": "<p>Yes, we offer post-inspection certification if installation meets torque, alignment, and material specs. Non-compliant installs require retrofit adjustments.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Where can I learn about installation standards?",
        "a": "<p>Review our <a href=\"/faq/flood-barrier-installation\">installation guide</a> and <a href=\"/products/doorway-flood-panel\">Doorway Flood Panel</a> specifications.</p>"
