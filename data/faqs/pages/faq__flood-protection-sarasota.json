        "q": "Why is flood protection important in Sarasota?",
        "a": "<p>Sarasota's coastal elevation averages only 9 ft NGVD. Heavy rainfall and storm surge from Big Pass regularly cause back-flow flooding. Installing barriers on ground-level doors prevents loss during Gulf events. See <a href=\"/home-flood-barriers/sarasota\">Sarasota Home Flood Barriers</a>.</p>"

    {
        "q": "Are permits required for residential flood barriers in Sarasota County?",
