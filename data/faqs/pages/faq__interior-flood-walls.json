        "q": "What are interior flood walls?",
        "a": "<p>Low walls built inside garages or basements that block minor flooding while allowing normal use. Typically 2–3 ft tall with removable gate sections.</p>"

        "q": "When are interior walls preferable to exterior barriers?",
        "a": "<p>When property lines or historic façades restrict exterior anchoring. They isolate vulnerable zones without exterior alteration.</p>"

        "q": "How are they constructed?",
        "a": "<p>Concrete or block cores with waterproof coatings and integrated gasketed gates. Design follows <a href=\"/faq/building-code-standards\">building-code standards</a>.</p>"

        "a": "<p>Drainage sumps or check valves prevent standing water. Vapor barriers behind finishes control humidity.</p>"

        "q": "Can they be decorative?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—clad with stone, tile, or wood veneers. Architectural integration adds value and function.</p>"
