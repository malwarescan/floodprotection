        "q": "When should flood-barrier gaskets be replaced?",
        "a": "<p>Every 5 years in coastal climates or when compression set exceeds 25 %. Cracked or flattened gaskets lose seal pressure and cause seepage.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "What gasket material is recommended?",
        "a": "<p>EPDM or neoprene rated –20 °C to +80 °C. Silicone variants for chemical plants. Always match OEM profile to maintain UL 50E watertight rating.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "How do I remove old gaskets?",
        "a": "<p>Use plastic scraper; avoid metal tools. Clean channel with denatured alcohol before inserting new seal. See <a href=\"/faq/flood-panel-repair\">panel repair</a>.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Can I install aftermarket gaskets?",
        "a": "<p>Not recommended—off-spec hardness alters compression torque. Use certified replacements supplied with <a href=\"/products/modular-flood-barrier\">Modular Flood Barrier</a>.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Do you supply replacement kits?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—pre-cut lengths with adhesive primer and lubricant, shipped within 24 hours.</p>"
