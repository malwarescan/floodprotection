        "q": "What flood protection solutions work best for Sarasota homes?",
        "a": "<p>Sarasota's coastal location and storm surge risk require robust flood barriers rated for Category 3+ storms. Our aluminum modular barriers with EPDM gaskets provide watertight seals up to 36 inches above threshold. For historic downtown properties, we offer custom-fit panels that preserve architectural character.</p><p>See our <a href=\"/home-flood-barriers/sarasota\">Sarasota flood barrier installations</a> for examples.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "How quickly can flood panels be installed in Sarasota?",
        "a": "<p>Standard installations complete within 24-48 hours for most Sarasota properties. Custom measurements for historic homes may extend to 5-7 days. Emergency installations are available during active storm warnings with same-day deployment for pre-measured openings.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Are flood barriers required by Sarasota building codes?",
        "a": "<p>Sarasota follows Florida Building Code requirements for flood-resistant construction in Zone AE and VE. While flood barriers aren't mandatory for existing homes, they're required for new construction in flood zones. Our installations exceed code minimums and may qualify for insurance discounts.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "What's the cost range for Sarasota flood protection?",
        "a": "<p>Complete flood protection for a typical Sarasota home ranges from $8,000-$25,000 depending on openings, barrier type, and installation complexity. Modular aluminum barriers start at $150 per linear foot. Custom solutions for historic properties may cost more due to specialized fabrication.</p>"

    {
        "q": "How do I maintain flood barriers in Sarasota's salty environment?",
        "a": "<p>Monthly rinsing with fresh water prevents salt buildup. Annual inspection of gaskets and hardware is recommended. We use 316 stainless steel hardware and marine-grade coatings specifically chosen for Sarasota's coastal conditions. See our <a href=\"/faq/hardware-corrosion-control\">corrosion control guide</a>.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Can flood barriers be installed on historic Sarasota homes?",
        "a": "<p>Yes, with careful planning to preserve architectural character. We offer custom-fit panels that match existing openings and reversible installation methods. Historic preservation guidelines are followed, and installations can be removed without damage to original materials.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "What flood zones require protection in Sarasota?",
        "a": "<p>Zone AE (100-year floodplain) and Zone VE (coastal high hazard) require flood-resistant construction. Zone X (500-year floodplain) is recommended for protection. Our site surveys identify your specific zone and recommend appropriate barrier heights and anchoring systems.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Do Sarasota flood barriers qualify for insurance discounts?",
        "a": "<p>FEMA-approved flood barriers may qualify for NFIP premium reductions of 5-45% depending on barrier type and installation method. We provide documentation for insurance submissions and coordinate with your agent to maximize savings.</p>"
