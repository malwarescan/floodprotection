        "q": "Can flood barriers be used on historic homes?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—reversible installations that avoid altering the original façade are preferred. Clamp-frame panels preserve masonry and meet preservation-board standards. See <a href=\"/faq/building-code-standards\">building-code standards</a>.</p>"

        "q": "Do I need approval from a preservation board?",
        "a": "<p>Usually yes. Submit color renderings, anchor details, and a reversibility statement. We prepare drawings for local review.</p>"

        "q": "How can barriers blend with period architecture?",

        "a": "<p>Yes—anchors must avoid decorative stone or brick edges. Compression-mounted frames are non-invasive alternatives.</p>"

        "a": "<p>Yes—barriers paired with interior sump pumps keep wood floors and plaster dry while maintaining the original exterior.</p>"
