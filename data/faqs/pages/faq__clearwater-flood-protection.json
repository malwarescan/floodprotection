        "q": "How does flood protection differ between Clearwater Beach and inland properties?",
        "a": "<p>Coastal lots face direct surge and wave impact, requiring higher panel ratings and stainless anchoring. Inland Clearwater properties mostly manage rainfall runoff and canal backflow; removable flood boards or doorway panels are usually sufficient.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "What flood barrier systems work best in Clearwater's sandy soils?",
        "a": "<p>Systems using mechanical anchoring with deep-set stainless inserts perform best. Freestanding barriers may shift in sandy substrates if unanchored.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Can existing garage openings be retrofitted?",
        "a": "<p>Yes. We mount side channels using epoxy-anchored bolts that don't require structural redesign. The barrier can be removed after hurricane season.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Does Clearwater require permits for residential flood barriers?",
        "a": "<p>Minor permits are needed only for permanent anchors. Our engineers file electronically with Pinellas County's ePlans system for homeowners.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Are Clearwater flood panels reusable after multiple floods?",
        "a": "<p>Panels are rated for 30+ deployment cycles if stored dry. Inspect gaskets for compression wear and replace as needed.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "What maintenance plan do you recommend?",
        "a": "<p>Post-storm rinse, annual gasket check, and hardware torque verification. We provide optional service contracts that include annual inspection and re-certification.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "How do I choose between flood boards and modular barriers?",
        "a": "<p>Flood boards are economical for low openings (under 24 inches). Modular barriers cover wider spans and offer faster deployment for garages or patios.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Does Clearwater's elevation reduce flood risk?",
        "a": "<p>Average elevation is 16 ft NGVD, but surge from Clearwater Pass can exceed 6 ft in severe storms. Barriers remain recommended for ground-floor openings.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Can systems be color-matched to my home?",
        "a": "<p>Yes, powder-coated finishes in RAL colors are available to meet HOA aesthetic requirements.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Where can I see an installation in Clearwater?",
        "a": "<p>Schedule a viewing through our <a href=\"/home-flood-barriers/clearwater\">Clearwater flood barrier office</a>; we maintain demo sites near Sand Key Road.</p>"
