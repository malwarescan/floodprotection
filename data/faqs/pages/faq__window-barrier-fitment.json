        "q": "Can flood barriers be fitted to window openings?",
        "a": "<p>Yes. We fabricate lightweight frames that secure with hidden anchors behind trim. Panels overlap mullions to maintain continuous seal across the sill.</p>"

        "q": "What glazing clearances are required?",
        "a": "<p>Minimum 2 inches between frame and glazing edge to allow compression track installation without stressing glass. Templates are taken with laser measurement.</p>"

    {
        "q": "How do you prevent condensation or damage to windows?",
        "a": "<p>EPDM gaskets isolate the panel from glass surfaces, preventing scratching and thermal bridging. Panels are removable for daily light and airflow.</p>"

    {
        "q": "Are window barriers code-compliant?",
        "a": "<p>Yes, tested to ASTM E331 for water penetration. Installations remain reversible for historical properties.</p>"
