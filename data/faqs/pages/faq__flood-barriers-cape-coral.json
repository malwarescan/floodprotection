        "q": "Why are flood barriers important for Cape Coral canal homes?",
        "a": "<p>Back-flow through seawall weeps and low-lying driveways causes frequent garage flooding. Removable panels seal thresholds without interfering with boat access. See <a href=\"/home-flood-barriers/cape-coral\">Cape Coral installations</a>.</p>"

        "q": "Can I install barriers without damaging paver driveways?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—anchors drill through pavers into slab and use flush caps. Aesthetic impact is minimal.</p>"

    {
        "q": "Do barriers affect property value?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—homes with engineered dry-floodproofing appraise 5–8 % higher per local RE reports. Certificates included with closing documents.</p>"

        "q": "How do barriers perform against canal overtopping?",
        "a": "<p>Rated for hydrostatic head up to 40 inches. Systems tested to 4 psi per ASTM E330.</p>"

        "q": "Are permits needed near waterfront lots?",
        "a": "<p>Yes under City of Cape Coral Waterfront Structure Permit. We prepare drawings and submit with engineer seal.</p>"
