        "q": "Can planters or berms act as barriers?",
        "a": "<p>Yes if properly compacted and lined with geomembranes. They complement mechanical barriers but should not replace them in high-risk zones.</p>"

        "q": "How do rain gardens help?",
        "a": "<p>They absorb excess runoff, reducing flow toward building openings. Maintenance prevents clogging during storms.</p>"

        "q": "Will vegetation damage barrier tracks?",
        "a": "<p>Not if trimmed regularly. Keep 6 inches clearance around anchors and gaskets to prevent root intrusion.</p>"
