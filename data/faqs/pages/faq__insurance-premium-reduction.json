        "q": "Can flood barriers lower my insurance premium?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—documented dry-floodproofing can yield 5–15 % premium reductions with select carriers. Submit sealed drawings and photos. See <a href=\"/faq/flood-barrier-insurance-benefits\">insurance benefits</a>.</p>"

        "a": "<p>Rarely. They may request photos or videos verifying deployment. We supply a homeowner verification kit for easy proof.</p>"

        "q": "Is there paperwork to submit?",
