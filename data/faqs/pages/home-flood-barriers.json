        "q": "What are home flood barriers and how do they protect my property?",
        "a": "<p>Home flood barriers are watertight barriers installed at entry points (doors, windows, garage openings) to prevent floodwater from entering your home during storms. Our barriers use FEMA-approved materials that can withstand hydrostatic pressure, protecting your property from thousands of dollars in water damage.</p><p>See our <a href=\"/home-flood-barriers/miami\">Miami home flood barriers</a> for coastal protection.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "How much do home flood barriers cost?",
        "a": "<p>Home flood barrier costs typically range from $899-$1,499 per opening, depending on size and materials. Garage door systems start around $1,299. Our modular systems are reusable and pay for themselves by protecting your property from a single flood event.</p><p>We offer free assessments and can help you qualify for <a href=\"/faq/grant-programs\">flood mitigation grants</a> up to $10,000 from FEMA.</p>"

    {
        "q": "How long does installation take?",
        "a": "<p>Typical 3–5 opening installation completes within one working day. We measure, fabricate, and install in a single visit. Complex installations with multiple garage openings may require 2–3 days.</p><p>Emergency installation available within 24-48 hours for active storm alerts.</p>"

    {
        "q": "What maintenance do home flood barriers require?",

Annual gasket inspection and periodic hardware checks extend the 10-year warranty.</p><p>Gaskets typically last 5-7 years with normal use. We provide replacement parts and <a href=\"/faq/gasket-replacement\">gasket replacement service</a>.</p>"
