        "q": "What is the environmental impact of flood-barrier systems?",
        "a": "<p>Minimal. Barriers are passive, non-powered, and used only during storms. Manufacturing uses recyclable aluminum and stainless steel. Compared to post-flood reconstruction, barriers reduce landfill waste by over 90 %.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Do flood barriers affect local water flow?",
        "a": "<p>No—properly installed barriers protect structures without obstructing drainage systems. Site grading ensures runoff stays directed to existing channels.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Can flood barriers reduce long-term environmental damage?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—preventing interior flooding avoids mold growth, contaminated debris, and chemical runoff into soil and waterways.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Are coatings or sealants environmentally safe?",
        "a": "<p>Our finishes use low-VOC powder coatings and solvent-free marine sealants. They meet EPA and RoHS standards.</p>"
    },
    {
        "q": "Do you recycle old barrier components?",
        "a": "<p>Yes—retired aluminum panels are 100 % recyclable. Hardware is separated by alloy type for responsible disposal.</p>"
