# Strategic Plan: LeeCounty.app Authority Network
**Objective:** Leverage `leecounty.app` (Local News/Authority Site) to dominate local search rankings for `floodbarrierpros.com` in Southwest Florida (SWFL).

## 🏗 Phase 1: Infrastructure & "Official" Status
**Goal:** Establish Flood Barrier Pros (FBP) as the de-facto "Flood Safety Partner" for the region.

### 1. The "Safety Partner" Widget
*   **Action:** Add a permanent **"Flood Zone Check"** widget or sidebar link on `leecounty.app`.
*   **Copy:** "Know Your Zone: Official Lee County Flood Risk Check | Powered by [Flood Barrier Pros]"
*   **Target:** `floodbarrierpros.com/contact` (or a dedicated landing page)
*   **SEO Value:** Sitewide authority link from a geo-relevant domain.

### 2. The Local Business Directory
*   **Action:** Create a `/local-resources/emergency-services` page on the news site.
*   **Listing:**
    *   **Category:** "Disaster Preparedness & Flood Mitigation"
    *   **Listing:** Flood Barrier Pros
    *   **NAP:** Ensure Name, Address, Phone matches Google Business Profile exactly.
    *   **Embed:** Embed the FBP Google Map directly on this page.
*   **SEO Value:** Strong local signal to Google Maps Pack for "Flood Barriers near me."

## 📰 Phase 2: Editorial Calendar (The "News Hook" Strategy)
**Goal:** Publish 1 article per month that targets specific SWFL cities and links to matching "Matrix Pages" on FBP.

| Month | Headline Idea | Target City | FBP Link Target | Anchor Text Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Feb** | "New Fort Myers Building Codes: What Commercial Property Owners Need to Know" | **Fort Myers** | `/commercial-flood-gates` | "commercial flood gates in Fort Myers" |
| **Mar** | "Cape Coral Canal Homes: Why Sandbags Are Failing Against Recent King Tides" | **Cape Coral** | `/home-flood-barriers/cape-coral` | "Cape Coral home flood barriers" |
| **Apr** | "Sanibel Recovery Update: How New Flood Tech is Speeding Up Rebuilding" | **Sanibel** | `/residential-flood-panels/sanibel` | "flood protection for Sanibel homes" |
| **May** | "Hurricane Prep 2026: The 'Garage Vulnerability' Most Estero Homes Have" | **Estero** | `/products/garage-dam-kit` | "garage flood protection kits" |
| **Jun** | "Bonita Springs Flood Risk Report: Specific Zones Requiring Retrofits" | **Bonita Spgs** | `/home-flood-barriers/bonita-springs` | "Bonita Springs flood prevention" |

### Editorial Rules:
1.  **News First:** The article must be 80% helpful, local news (e.g., citing verified flood stages, city council quotes).
2.  **The "Expert" Quote:** Always include a quote from FBP: *"According to local engineers at Flood Barrier Pros..."*
3.  **One Link Rule:** Only one "money link" per article to keep it looking natural.

---

## 🎯 Phase 3: The "Case Study" Series
**Goal:** Validate social proof using local landmarks.

### 1. "The Neighborhood Report"
*   **Concept:** Feature a specific neighborhood (e.g., "The Yacht Club Area in Cape Coral").
*   **Content:** Discuss specific flood challenges of that neighborhood (seawall height, drainage).
*   **Tie-In:** Mention how residents are solving it. *"Several homeowners on Driftwood Pkwy have installed [removable flood barriers](/removable-barriers) to banish sandbags forever."*

### 2. "Commercial Spotlight"
*   **Concept:** Spotlight a local business that "Beat the Storm."
*   **Content:** Interview a business owner in Fort Myers River District who stayed dry.
*   **Tie-In:** *"We installed [commercial flood gates](/commercial-flood-gates) two days before the storm, and it saved our inventory."*

---

## 🔗 Phase 4: Interlinking Map (The "Link Juice" Flow)
**Objective:** Ensure link equity flows to the hardest-to-rank pages.

*   **Homepage of News Site** -> Links to **FBP Home** (Brand Authority)
*   **Safety/Prep Articles** -> Link to **FBP City Pages** (Local Rank)
    *   *Example:* Article about Cape Coral links ONLY to `/home-flood-barriers/cape-coral`.
    *   *Example:* Article about Business Prep links ONLY to `/commercial-flood-gates`.
