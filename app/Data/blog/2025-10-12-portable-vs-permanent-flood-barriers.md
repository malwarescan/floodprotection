## Expert Recommendations by Region

### Florida

**Coastal Areas** (High Risk):
- Permanent: Modular aluminum systems
- Minimum 6 ft protection height
- Hurricane-rated anchors

**Inland Areas** (Moderate Risk):
- Hybrid: Permanent doors + portable elsewhere
- 3-4 ft protection adequate
- Focus on drainage integration

### Texas

**Houston/Coastal**:
- Permanent for businesses
- Portable acceptable for homes if deployed quickly

**Inland**:
- Portable systems usually sufficient
- Focus on rapid deployment

### Arizona

**Monsoon Zones**:
- Portable systems effective
- Quick-deploy models
- Lower heights adequate (2-3 ft)

## Conclusion

There's no universal "better" choice—the right flood barrier system depends on your specific situation. Permanent systems offer superior protection and long-term value for high-risk properties, while portable systems provide flexibility and cost savings for moderate-risk or temporary situations.

**General Guidelines**:
- **High risk** + **permanent residence** = Permanent system
- **Moderate risk** + **flexibility needed** = Portable system  
- **Maximum protection** on budget = Hybrid approach

**Take Action**:
1. Assess your flood risk using FEMA maps
2. Calculate your budget and 5-year cost
3. Consider your residence timeline
4. Get quotes for both options
5. Make an informed decision
