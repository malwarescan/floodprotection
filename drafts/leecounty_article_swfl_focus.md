**FORT MYERS, FL** — As residents in Pinellas County continue to clean up from the recent storm surge failure that devastated a St. Petersburg luxury home, local engineers in Lee County are issuing a warning to homeowners in **Cape Coral**, **Fort Myers**, and **Sanibel**: Don't let your garage be the weak link.

The [viral failure in St. Petersburg](https://www.floodbarrierpros.com/blog/2025-09-29-epic-flood-barrier-fail-st-pete) occurred when a standard barrier system was overwhelmed by hydrostatic pressure, lifting the garage slab. While that home was 100 miles north, the soil conditions and surge risks are nearly identical to those found along the Caloosahatchee River and Cape Coral's 400 miles of canals.

"The lesson for Southwest Florida is that a garage door is not a flood wall," says the lead engineer at **[Flood Barrier Pros](/home-flood-barriers/fort-myers)**, a local firm specializing in FEMA-compliant protection. "We see many newer residents in Estero and Bonita Springs attempting to waterproof standard breakdown doors. That is a recipe for disaster."

### Use the Right Tool for the Zone

Local experts recommend that residents check their Flood Zone designation before purchasing protection.

*   **For Cape Coral Canal Homes:** The risk often comes from rapid water rise. [Residential flood panels designed for Cape Coral](/home-flood-barriers/cape-coral) need to account for saltwater corrosion and rapid deployment.
*   **For Fort Myers & River District:** Historic properties often have uneven driveways. [Fort Myers flood protection](/home-flood-barriers/fort-myers) often requires custom-fitted gaskets that can seal against paver driveways or cracked concrete.
*   **For Barrier Islands (Sanibel/Captiva):** With higher surge potential, [heavy-duty barrier systems](/residential-flood-panels/sanibel) are often required to meet code compliance and insurer requirements.

### Getting Ready for 2026

Lee County officials remind residents that lead times for flood protection materials can stretch to 8-10 weeks once a named storm enters the Gulf. 

"Now is the time to audit your garage," says the Flood Barrier Pros team. "If you can see light under your garage door, water will find a way in."
