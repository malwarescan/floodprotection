**SANIBEL, FL** — As the reconstruction of Sanibel continues, a distinct visual difference is emerging between the homes that were lost and the homes being built (or retrofitted) today.

Beyond the obvious elevation requirements, contractors are installing integrated flood defense systems that are far more discreet—and robust—than pre-Ian solutions.

"The aesthetic on Sanibel is crucial," says a specialized installer from **[Flood Barrier Pros](/residential-flood-panels/sanibel)**. "Residents want protection that creates a fortress during a hurricane but disappears during the dry season."

### Removable vs. Permanent
The trend on the islands has shifted toward **[Removable Flood Barriers](/removable-barriers)**. These systems use permanent, architectural-grade channels mounted to doorframes, but the actual barriers are lightweight aluminum stored in the garage.

*   **When a Watch is issued:** Homeowners slide the planks in.
*   **During Season:** The views of the Gulf are unobstructed.

For ground-level storage areas and garages (which are structurally mandated to be "breakaway" or floodable in some zones, but protected in others), these [island-specific barrier kits](/residential-flood-panels/sanibel) prevent saltwater intrusion from smaller surges and tidal events, protecting electric vehicles and golf carts stored below the main living level.

**Island Advisory:** Sanibel Building Dept encourages all retrofits to be permitted well before August. [View approved flood protection options for Sanibel](/residential-flood-panels/sanibel).
