Hi Flood Barrier Pros team,

Great news! Your NDJSON factlets are now successfully integrated into Casa's homeowner intelligence platform.

---

## ✅ **What's Working Right Now**

Your data from `floodbarrierpros.com` is:

1. ✅ **Successfully ingested by Croutons** (validated & stored)

2. ✅ **Powering real homeowner queries** via Casa AI

3. ✅ **Providing localized flood protection advice** for Fort Myers area (ZIP 33908)

### **Example Query:**

```
User asks: "My garage keeps flooding when it rains" (Fort Myers, 33908)
```

### **Casa Response (powered by your data):**

```
Assessment: Home in a flood-risk area with ground-level garage flooding issue

Risk Score: 0.75 (Caution)

Likely Causes:

• Insufficient drainage near garage entrance

• Backflow from street drains during heavy rain

• Lack of flood barriers or seals

Recommended Steps:

• Install removable flood barrier at garage entrance

• Add trench drain and ensure gutters discharge away from driveway

• Check for proper grading around garage

• Consider professional flood barrier installation

Cost Estimate: $1,200-$3,500

Best Timing: Before hurricane season (May-November)
```
